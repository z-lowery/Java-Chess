## Project Explaination

This is a personal project I did in prepreation for the programming class I would be going into during my first year at UW-Madison (junior year). I hadn't taken up Java since my freshman year as my sophmore year was focused on C and Assembly, so I thought it would be a good way to freshen up on some Java skills.
